                    <p>Hamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.
                        His father, Anthony Hamilton, is black and is of Grenadian descent, while his mother, Carmen Larbalestier, is White British, and from Birmingham, making him mixed-race; Hamilton has identified as black.Hamilton's parents separated when he was two, after which he lived with his mother and older half-sisters,
                         Samantha and Nicola, until he was twelve.Hamilton then lived with his father, stepmother Linda, and his half-brother Nicolas, who is also a professional racing driver.Hamilton was raised a Catholic

                    <p>Hamilton's father bought him a radio-controlled car when he was five. Hamilton finished second in the national BRCA championship the following year against adult competition. Being the only black child racing at his club, Hamilton was subjected to racist abuse. Hamilton's father bought him a go-kart for Christmas when he was six and promised to support his racing career as long as he worked hard at school. To support his son, Hamilton's father took redundancy from his position as an IT manager and became a contractor, sometimes working up to four jobs at a time including employment as a double glazing salesman, dishwasher, and putting up signs for estate agents, while still attending his son's races. Hamilton's father later set up his own IT company.
                        He continued to be Hamilton's manager until early 2010.</p>

                    <p>Hamilton was educated at The John Henry Newman School, a voluntary aided Catholic secondary school in Stevenage.Hamilton has said that at the age of five he took up karate to defend himself as a result of bullying at school.
                       He was also excluded from school for a period when he was mistakenly identified as having attacked a fellow student who was treated in hospital for his injuries. In addition to racing, he played association football for his school team with eventual England international, Ashley Young. Hamilton, an Arsenal fan, said that if Formula One had not worked for him, he would have been a footballer or a cricketer, having played both for his school teams</p>

                    <p>Hamilton began karting in 1993 and quickly began winning races and cadet class championships.
                       Two years later, he became the youngest driver to win the British cadet karting championship at the age of ten.
                       When Hamilton was 12, Ladbrokes took a bet, at 40/1 odds, that Hamilton would win a Formula One race before the age of 23; another predicted, at 150/1 odds, that he would win the World Drivers' Championship before he was 25. In 1998, Dennis called Hamilton following his second Super One series and British championship wins, to offer Hamilton a role in the McLaren driver development programme.</p>

                    <p>Hamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series, finishing fifth in the standings.
                         This led to a full 2002 Formula Renault UK campaign with Manor Motorsport in which he finished fifth overall. 
                         He remained with Manor for another year, winning the championship ahead of Alex Lloyd.Having clinched the championship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make his debut in the season finale of the British Formula 3 Championship
                         In his first race he was forced out with a puncture,and in the second he crashed out and was taken to hospital after a collision with teammate Tor Graves.

                <p>Hamilton moved to ASM's sister GP2 team, ART Grand Prix, for the 2006 season. Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first
                     attempt, beating Nelson Piquet Jr. and Alexandre Prémat. He secured a dominant win at the Nürburgring, despite a penalty 
                     for speeding in the pit lane. At his home race at Silverstone, Hamilton overtook two rivals at Becketts, a series of
                      high-speed bends where overtaking is rare. In Istanbul he recovered from a spin that left him in eighteenth place to take
                       second. Hamilton won the title in unusual circumstances, inheriting the final point he needed after Giorgio Pantano was stripped of fastest lap in the Monza feature race.</p>

            Hamilton's first season in Formula One saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. Hamilton is the first and, as of 2023, the only black driver to race in the series.
             After finishing on the podium in his debut, Hamilton went on to set several records as he finished runner-up in the 2007 World Drivers' Championship to Kimi Räikkönen by one point, including those for the most 
             consecutive podium finishes from debut (9), the joint most wins in a debut season (4) and the most points in a debut season (109)

            Upon signing with Mercedes in 2013, Hamilton was reunited with his childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg.
             The move was met with surprise by pundits and the public, with some describing the move to Mercedes, a team with no 
             recent history of success, as a gamble. In his first season with the Silver Arrows, Hamilton secured a sole race victory, 
             winning the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he converted an unexpected pole position into a winning margin of over 11 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Kimi Räikkönen,
              alongside a number of podium finishes and pole positions,
             finishing fourth in the standings once again, the third time in five years.

            Early on in the 2021 season, Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen emerged as title favourites.
             The pair frequently exchanged the championship lead throughout the season—often sparring (and occasionally coming together) on track—and entered the last race in Abu Dhabi level on points. In Abu Dhabi, Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the final lap of the race, denying Hamilton his eighth title. During the season,
             Hamilton became the first driver to surpass 100 pole positions and 100 race wins, respectively.

        <div class="tab-panel" id="tab4">
            Following Rosberg's retirement, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival as the pair exchanged the championship lead throughout 2017 in a tense title fight. Hamilton registered 11 pole positions that season as he took the record for the all-time most pole positions, and his consistency (finishing every race in the points),
             as well as a lack of a serious challenge from his new teammate Valtteri Bottas, saw him record nine race victories and secure his fourth World Drivers' title as he overturned a points deficit to Vettel in the first half of the season, ultimately wrapping the title up in Mexico with two races to spare
             The 2018 season was the first time that two four-time World Champions, Hamilton and Vettel, would be competing for a fifth title and was billed as the "Fight for Five" by journalists and fans. As with the season before, Ferrari and Vettel appeared to have the upper hand for much of the season, topping the standings until the half-way point. However, Vettel's season unravelled with a number of driver and mechanical errors, while Hamilton's run of six wins in seven in the latter half of the season saw Hamilton clinch the title in Mexico for a second year running as he set a new record for the most points scored in a season (408).

            Hamilton was partnered by George Russell for 2022, in place of the departing Bottas. The season saw significant changes in technical regulations which sought to 
            utilise ground effect to generate downforce. During pre-season testing in Bahrain, Mercedes introduced its "zero sidepod" car design, which was radically different 
            to that of its competitors. The Mercedes W13 suffered with extreme porpoising early in the season which limited the car's potential;
             at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Hamilton deemed the car "undrivable".
